If you want your packages added to the search database, please do the
following on your webserver.  This will allow my Recipe/Package
Browser to index your packages.

$ cd <package-dir>
$ wget http://gobo.dreamhosters.com/recipes/find.inc
$ mv find.inc .find.php

Email me a nice note asking me to add your packages to the database.
